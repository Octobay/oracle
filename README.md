# Octobay Oracle

[Demo](https://octobay.github.io/oracle/)

Make sure you have a [`.octobay.json` config](#octobay-config) with an address. Otherwise the oracle will not service your requests.

## Octobay Config

As a user, in order to receive funds via Octobay or trigger oracle jobs, all you need to do is adding a config file with an Ethereum address to your [Readme Repository](https://docs.github.com/en/github/creating-cloning-and-archiving-repositories/creating-a-repository-on-github/about-readmes). Simply create a repository named after your username (like: https://github.com/mktcode/mktcode) and put this config file in it:

`.octobay.json`
```
{
  "address": "your address"
}
```
